            <h2>Work Expirence</h2>
            <p>[As a cybersecurity intern, I gained invaluable hands-on experience in protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. I learned about various cybersecurity threats, such as malware, phishing, and denial-of-service attacks, and how to mitigate them.
                One of the key areas I explored was network security, which involved securing an organization's networks and infrastructure from cyber threats. This included configuring firewalls, implementing intrusion detection and prevention systems, and monitoring network traffic for suspicious activities.
                I also delved into application security, ensuring that software applications were secure from vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. This involved performing code reviews, penetration testing, and implementing secure coding practices.
                Additionally, I learned about incident response and forensics, which involve detecting, investigating, and responding to security incidents, as well as gathering and analyzing digital evidence to identify the source and scope of an attack.
                Throughout my internship, I acquired practical skills in using various cybersecurity tools and technologies, such as firewalls, antivirus software, vulnerability scanners, and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.</p>
