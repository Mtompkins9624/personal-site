            <h2>Michael Tompkins</h2>
            <p>[Hello My Name is Michael Tompkins. I Graduted From Brigam Young University located in Rexburg Idaho. I am married to my amazing wife Jessica for 3 years now. 
                I was born in North Carolina and grew up in a small country town.
                I grew up without alot of technology and spent most of my time outdoors. 
                Now some of my favorite things to do are snow boarding and fishing. I love being outdoors no matter what the weather is. 
                I also love learning more about ways to protect myself and loved ones from the ever increasing attacks coming from threat actors. 
                I also love teaching people ways to avoid being scammed and recomending simple free tools to help protect themsevles and their imformation.
                I love the field of cyber secuirty i beleive its extremely important to activty fight again the evil of threat actors looking to take advantage of people.]</p>
